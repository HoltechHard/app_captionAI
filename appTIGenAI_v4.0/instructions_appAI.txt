1. TITLE OF TASK

BUILD A SYSTEM FOR GENERATING A TITLE FROM AN IMAGE

2. SUBTASKS RELATED WITH THE PROJECT

	2.1) Find a good dataset: accurable and with good volume
	     to can achieve good levels of accuracy in the future.
	 - what public datasets we have able to this?

    2.2) Looking for papers: 
	 - check in other researchs how we can solve this task. 
         - How architectures and datasets we have able to use in our project

    2.3) Define framework and language - good variants:
    	 - python + tensorflow with keras
    	 - python + pytorch
    	 - some modern pipeline?
    	 - OpenCV can be used?

    2.4) Define possible architectures of neural networks to 
    	 fix this task
	 - initially BERT is a good option?
	 - convolutional - recurrent neural network?

    2.5) Define the infrastructure and capacity of processing 
    	 for our algorithm
    	 - DevOps Technologies => containers? docker? kubernets? 
    	 - Big Data Tecnologies? Cloud Computing infrastructure? 
    	 - Supercomputer, GPUs, Parallel programming? CUDA?

    2.6) Software Enginnering + System Developping 
    	 - What fronted? => what languages we will use?
    	 - What backed? => what languages we will use?

    2.7) Analysis
    	 - How type of report we will expect to do and 
    	   how type of results we expect to achieve?
